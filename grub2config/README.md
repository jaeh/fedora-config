===============================        
                                    
Version history:

 0.0.1: first test release 

Introduction:
 
 This is a discordian theme for grub2.

Usage:  
 !tested on fedora only!
 
 get the git repo with my config files:
 
 git clone https://github.com/jaeh/fedora-config.gitgetdir
 
Remarks:
 This theme does not contain any important text in a fixed language,
 to change the text above the picture just change the image.

 It also needs a lot of tinkering to get it to run, since lots of the settings are unique to each system.
 I will see if i can find a way to get this more portable :(

TODO: 
 
 use a textfield with the hostname instead of the text in the image
 
 maybe: get the apple to rotate to indicate loading or make some other kind of anim, kind of unneeded since the screen only pops up for a second in my settings ;)
