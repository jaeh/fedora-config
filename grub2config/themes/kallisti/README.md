    Remarks: 
     
     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     
     the image has been stolen from the internet years ago.
     i recently tried to find the creator by emailing all the addresses i found when whois'ing the urls of the images available.

     unfortunately no luck.
     
     in case you know the owner of that art please tell me to enable me to ask if i am allowed to use it!

     This theme does not contain any important text in a fixed language,
     to change the text above the picture just change the image.


    TODO: 
     
     use a textfield with the hostname instead of the text in the image
     
     maybe: get the apple to rotate to indicate loading or make some other kind of anim, kind of unneeded since the screen only pops up for a second in my settings ;)
